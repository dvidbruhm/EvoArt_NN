# EvoArt
Very simple program to create evolutionary art using CPPNs and a genetic algorithm. 

# Requirements
- [python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)
- [pytorch](https://www.pytorch.org)

Note: the program will run much faster with a cuda compatible GPU, but a CPU is still usable.

# Usage
Clone or download the repository, then run main.py:
```
python3 main.py
```
